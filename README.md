Tech used: HTML

I started this webpage by creating the initial structure. I did this by creating a directory and adding files into that directory. I then created a recipe page for each recipe. I filled these recipe pages with headings,paragraphs, images, unordered lists, and ordered lists. Throughout this process I added commit messages to my git log, and in the end I pushed these commits to GitHub. 

Lesson Learned:
I had trouble getting my images to show up on my webpage. I figured out that I was not referencing the right directory and that is why my images wouldn't show up.
